      <h2>Research Questions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Who controls the distribution of light in cities, and how does light become a tool of governance, surveillance, or exclusion?</strong>
          <p>Urban lighting is rarely neutral. Decisions about where, when, and how intensely to illuminate a space often reflect broader systems of power, control, and governance—light can be used to shape human behavior, extend economic activity, and assert authority.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Light is used to shape behavior and perception:
              <ul>
                <li>Commercial districts stay brightly lit to extend consumption hours.</li>
                <li>Street lighting design affects perceptions of safety and order.</li>
                <li>Surveillance systems rely on constant illumination to enhance visibility.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Sometimes, the absence of light is also a political act — darkness is imposed to exclude, disempower, or neglect certain communities.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <strong>Can a game-based framework critically reflect on the politics of light, visibility, and darkness?</strong>
          <p>Games offer a structured space to simulate and reflect on real-world systems. Through mechanics, players can experience how illumination becomes a contested resource, and how visibility—or invisibility—shapes advantage, vulnerability, or resistance.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Actions such as "illuminate" or "dim" carry political consequences in the game world.</li>
            <li>Darkness becomes not just a passive state, but an active zone of negotiation, resistance, or sanctuary.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <strong>How might speculative gameplay help us rethink what a "right to darkness" might mean in the urban nightscape?</strong>
          <p>In most urban contexts, darkness is framed as a deficiency—something to eliminate for safety, productivity, or visibility. But darkness can also be a shared right: a condition that supports rest, privacy, biodiversity, and even wonder. Stargazing, sleep quality, and nocturnal wildlife all depend on darkness, yet it is often compromised by overlighting and light pollution. A speculative game can open space to explore what it might mean to defend darkness as a public good, and how city policy might change if the “right to darkness” were treated as seriously as the right to light.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Darkness is not merely the absence of light—it can be a form of freedom, ecology, intimacy, and rest:
              <ul>
                <li>For astronomers, it's a condition for seeing the stars;</li>
                <li>For wildlife, it's essential for survival;</li>
                <li>For residents, it provides privacy and peace;</li>
                <li>For cultural and spiritual life, it brings imagination, silence, and ritual.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Although this right doesn't currently exist in law, a speculative game allows players to experiment with its consequences and consider what policies might make it real.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Rhetorical Argument</h2>
      <blockquote>Design is power over perception.</blockquote>
      <p>This game is a critique of how illumination is normalized, weaponized, and commodified in the modern city.</p>
      <blockquote>Darkness is not absence—it is resistance, intimacy, ecology, and freedom.</blockquote>
      <p>Who gets to stay visible, and who gets to disappear?</p>
